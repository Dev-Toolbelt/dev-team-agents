description: Validate feature behavior against acceptance criteria
argument-hint: <feature to validate>
---

Load `skills/shared/current-context/SKILL.md` and restrict all work to the active branch/worktree scope unless $ARGUMENTS requests broader. Load `skills/shared/interaction-patterns/SKILL.md` and use `AskUserQuestion` for every question with a finite set of answers — never a plain-text prompt.

---

**MANDATORY:** Use the Task tool to spawn the agent below. Do NOT handle this task in the main context — always delegate. The only exception is if the user explicitly asks not to use agents.

Every Task spawn prompt below MUST end with, verbatim: "Before your last paragraph, emit your run-banner table under **Ran on:** exactly as defined in your agent file's `<!-- run-banner -->` block — this is not optional. Then close with a concise report only: files changed (paths, no diffs), key decisions and why, and anything the user must know. Do not paste full file contents, command logs, or a play-by-play of intermediate steps."

- `qa-specialist` at `.claude/agents/dev-team/qa-specialist.md` — validate feature behavior, acceptance criteria, regression, and end-to-end correctness

---

**PLAN GATE — mandatory for every spawned agent:**
1. Read `.dev-team-agents/user-data/preferences.json` → `language` field (default: `en`). Use that language for all responses, plans, and questions directed at the user.
2. Present a structured plan following `skills/shared/plan-mode/SKILL.md` and wait for explicit user approval before executing any file operation, command, or decision.
3. Do not execute and then explain — plan first, execute second. If the user says "just do it": write the plan anyway, explain it protects both parties, and wait for approval.
