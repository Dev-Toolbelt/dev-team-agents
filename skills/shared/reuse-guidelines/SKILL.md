# Reuse Guidelines

Structural-layer registry (see `skills/shared/project-context/SKILL.md` § Memory Layers — this is "current state: standards") that catalogs project-wide rules the team has explicitly decided to standardize on. Its job: stop the next task from re-deciding, ignoring, or drifting from something already settled.

A rule belongs here only when it is **not derivable from the code** and **will still be true after this sprint**. One-off preferences go in `docs/development/code-standards.md` instead.

## Registry File

`docs/development/reuse-guidelines.md` — one Markdown table, one row per rule:

```markdown
| name | type | rule | detection | canonical_ref |
|------|------|------|-----------|---------------|
| modal | code-pattern | Always use the shared Modal, never a new modal implementation | `\b(new Modal\(|<div[^>]*className=["'][^"']*\bmodal\b)` | src/components/Modal.tsx |
| upload_location | path-convention | Upload-handling files must live under xpto/pasta | `path:*Upload*=>xpto/pasta/` | xpto/pasta/ |
| buttons_left | design-rule | Buttons in section X are always left-aligned | (review-only — no regex; verify visually against canonical_ref) | docs/design/design-system.md#section-x |
```

Not code-fenced in the real file — this is a live Markdown table in `docs/development/reuse-guidelines.md`, readable as a normal doc and parseable with `awk -F'|'` (skip the header and the `---` separator row).

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `name` | Short identifier, used in violation messages and cross-references |
| `type` | `code-pattern` \| `path-convention` \| `design-rule` — decides which enforcement below applies |
| `rule` | One sentence, human-readable — what must always/never happen |
| `detection` | For `code-pattern`: an extended regex (`grep -E`) matched against **added** lines. For `path-convention`: `path:<name-glob>=><required-dir>` — any added/modified file whose basename matches `<name-glob>` must live under `<required-dir>`. For `design-rule`: literal `(review-only — ...)`, never a regex — nothing here is machine-checked |
| `canonical_ref` | The file, doc anchor, or path that IS the correct implementation/location |

The file does not exist until a project creates one. Its absence means no rule is registered — never treat that as a lint failure.

## Three Enforcement Behaviors, by `type`

| `type` | Mechanism | Who enforces |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `code-pattern` | `detection` regex run against added diff lines | `scripts/reuse-lint.sh` (hard, CI/Stop hook) **and** the review gate below |
| `path-convention` | Touched/added file's path checked against the `path:` glob in `detection` | `scripts/reuse-lint.sh` (hard, CI/Stop hook) **and** the review gate below |
| `design-rule` | Not mechanizable — no script can judge alignment, layout, or "follows pattern X/Y/Z" | **Review gate only** — see below. The hard part here is never skipping the row, not detecting it automatically |

## Review Gate (agents)

`code-reviewer`, `backend-reviewer`, and `frontend-reviewer` load this skill as part of their Foundational Rule additions. When `docs/development/reuse-guidelines.md` exists:

1. Read every row.
2. For `code-pattern` / `path-convention` rows: same check the lint script runs — report a match as `[BLOCKING]`, citing `name` and `canonical_ref`.
3. For `design-rule` rows: **iterate every row explicitly against the diff** — this cannot be delegated to a script, so skipping it silently is the one failure mode that matters here. If the changeset touches the area the `rule` describes and does not conform, report `[BLOCKING]` citing `name`, `rule`, and `canonical_ref`. If the row's area is untouched by the diff, say nothing about it.

Never copy the registry's rows into the review output — reference the row's `name` and let the file be the source of truth.

## Hard Lint (CI / Stop hook)

`scripts/reuse-lint.sh` runs the `code-pattern` and `path-convention` rows against `git diff` non-interactively and exits non-zero on any match. `design-rule` rows are parsed but never checked mechanically — they exist in the file for the review gate and for `/devteam:rule`'s traceability, not for the script. Degrades to exit 0 silently when the registry file is absent.

## Growing the Registry — Standardization Trigger and `/devteam:rule`

The registry is meant to grow without the user re-explaining a decision. Two paths write to it, sharing the same classify → propose → confirm → append routine — neither writes silently:

- **Passive capture**: the Convention / Standardization Signals already recognized by `skills/shared/docs-sync/references/update-triggers.md` — when one of those signals names a specific reusable component, path, or design rule (its "Where to write user-triggered entries" step 0), it routes here instead of to the wiki/code-standards.md. This skill does not restate that trigger table.
- **Explicit capture**: `/devteam:rule <description>` (see `commands/rule.md`), for when the user wants to catalog something outside the flow of another task.

Both resolve to the same steps:

1. Classify `type` from the description — `code-pattern` if it names a component/class/helper to reuse, `path-convention` if it's about file location, `design-rule` otherwise.
2. Derive `canonical_ref` from context (grep the repo for the named component/file; ask the user if it can't be resolved unambiguously).
3. For `code-pattern`, draft a `detection` regex from the canonical implementation's own markup/API — never a placeholder that would never match.
4. Show the proposed row to the user before writing it.
5. Append the confirmed row to `docs/development/reuse-guidelines.md`.

## Updating the Registry

Adding, editing, or retiring a row is a `docs/development/*.md`-class change — same Structural layer as `code-standards.md`. Retiring a rule: delete the row, do not comment it out — a disabled rule that still parses as active is a false negative waiting to happen.

**When the canonical implementation's dependency changes, update `detection` in the same change.** A `code-pattern` row's regex is often written against a specific import path or library name (e.g. `from '[r]eact-hot-toast'`). If a later task swaps that library (e.g. to `sonner`) without touching the registry row, the regex keeps parsing and `reuse-lint.sh` keeps exiting 0 — but it can no longer match the thing it exists to catch. This is a silent false negative, not a missing rule, so it will not surface on its own. Whenever you change what a `canonical_ref` file imports or depends on, grep the registry for rows whose `detection` references the old dependency and update them in the same commit.
