# Realtime (WebSocket)

## Detection Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `supabase.channel()` in code | Supabase Realtime |
| `REALTIME_*` env vars | Supabase Realtime service config |
| `realtime` service in `docker-compose.yml` | Self-hosted Realtime |
| `ws://` / `wss://` URLs in code | Generic WebSocket |
| `socket.io`, `ably`, `pusher` dependencies | Third-party WS providers |

## Supabase Realtime

Supabase Realtime is built on Phoenix channels (Elixir). It exposes three features via a single WebSocket connection:

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Broadcast** | Send arbitrary messages between clients via a named channel |
| **Presence** | Track which clients are connected to a channel and their state |
| **Postgres Changes** | Stream database mutations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) to clients |

## RLS and Realtime

Supabase Realtime enforces RLS for Postgres Changes. The JWT used to connect to the channel determines what data is streamed.

Pass the user JWT when creating the client (happens automatically if using `supabase-js` with active session). For server-side Realtime subscriptions, use the service-role key deliberately and be aware that all changes will flow through.

## Common Pitfalls

- Not calling `removeChannel` / `unsubscribe` on cleanup — channels accumulate and cause memory leaks
- Missing `replica identity full` — `payload.old` is empty on UPDATE/DELETE
- Subscribing to `postgres_changes` without RLS — all rows stream to all clients
- Opening multiple WebSocket connections for the same channel — use a singleton or channel registry
- Not handling `CHANNEL_ERROR` and `TIMED_OUT` statuses — the subscription silently stops working
- Sending large payloads via broadcast — keep under 1 MB; use Postgres + Postgres Changes for larger data
